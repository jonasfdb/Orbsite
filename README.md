# üì¶ About This Repository
This is the official repository for the website of my Discord bot Orb, which lives at **https://orb.jonasfdb.dev**.
If you are here, also check out the [source of the bot](https://github.com/jonasfdb/Orb), or directly [invite the bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=875699883460427836&permissions=1099780140278&integration_type=0&scope=bot).

This website is not intended to be self-hosted. It can be, no doubt, but it won't be of much use for any other bot without changes made to it. It is, however, always the exact code running on Orb's official website, so you know there is no shady stuff going on over there.

## ü§ù Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome! Please keep the scope to the website (content, copy, UI/UX, minor JS). Like with the bot, there's no real code standard to adhere to except for usual conventions.

**For bot features/bugs, use the Orb bot repository instead!**
